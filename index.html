                        <p>The American animated television series The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy features a cast
                            of fictional characters created by Maxwell Atoms. The series, which originally aired on
                            Cartoon Network from June 13, 2003 to October 12, 2008, follows two children, a dimwitted
                            boy named Billy (voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz) and a remorseless girl named Mandy
                            (voiced by Grey DeLisle). After winning a limbo game to save Billy's pet hamster, the two
                            gain the Grim Reaper (voiced by Greg Eagles) as their best friend for eternity, and come
                            across a variety of supernatural or otherworldly characters and locations throughout the
                            series. Billy, Mandy, and Grim are the main protagonists of the series. Irwin is secondary
                            character or also a main character in the show. Other characters are recurring or supporting
                            characters.
