                        <p>It's hard to believe that it's already been six years since the institution of rock was
                            turned on its face, the fame of the Beatles reduced to mere peanuts in the presence of
                            something so much more important and the inhabitants of the planet rendered lemmings to the
                            Doomsday ticking of Dethklok. Ok so maybe this is only a complete reality in the world of
                            the Adult Swim TV series Metalocalypse but creator/musician Brendon Small's cult creation
                            continues to thrive in both the music and animation realms. After being forced to reschedule
                            the beginning of their tour for the just-released Dethalbum III due to a schedule that --
                            eerily relevant to their fable -- matched the exact trajectory of Hurricane Sandy, the
                            virtual band is back at it, hitting Myth nightclub in St. Paul tonight. Prefacing this
                            inevitably cataclysmic performance, Gimme Noise was able to check in with the man behind the
                            macabre: famed creator of Home Movies and Metalocalypse, Brendon Small.</p>

                            Barrelli joins the show as co-host, much to Steve's chagrin. The two head to an airfield to
                            take a ride on a single-engine plane. Steve gets his hands dirty with diaper changing,
                            awkward courtship of another doctor, and the birthing of his own half-brother.</p>

                        <p>Calvin and Hobbes, revered by many as the last great newspaper comic strip, has a rich and
                            interesting history. There was a time when newspaper comics could be counted upon to be
                            funny, informative, witty, and so much more. Familiar, unforgettable characters like Charlie
                            Brown, Garfield, and, of course, Calvin and Hobbes all reliably played out regular short
                            stories that provided reliable humor and even insight in the pages of the paper. Nowadays,
                            comic strips don't quite have the same luster. Bill Watterson wrote and illustrated Calvin
                            and Hobbes from 1985 to 1995. He led Calvin and his stuffed animal/feline best friend Hobbes
                            on endless adventures for just ten years, but in that relatively brief time, the comic strip
                            would cemented its place in publication history. The imaginative world of Calvin and Hobbes
                            has inspired generations of fans young, but not everyone knows all of the Calvin and Hobbes
                            history. From what started the comic strip to why it ended to just why you can't go out and
                            buy a Hobbes plush, there are plenty of Calvin and Hobbes facts that enrich Bill Watterson's
                            world.</p>
