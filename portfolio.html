                        <p>Doug is an extremely short-tempered, easily angered, and imaginative young boy who is often
                            the target of being easily provoked or having a practical joke played on him. He is known
                            for having strong moral values and always knows to do the right thing. He also is famous for
                            his wild imagination, and often has various fantasy sequences in the series.

                            Doug has many friends, and his best friend is Skeeter Valentine. He met Skeeter on the day
                            he moved to Bluffington, and they've been the best of friends since then.</p>

                        <p>For our March 1998 cover, SPIN dedicated a number of features, interviews, and essays around
                            South Park ahead of the show’s second season. In honor of the 20th anniversary of the movie
                            South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, we’re reprinting a number of pieces about the infamously
                            potty-mouthed and politically incorrect cartoon here.

                            In retrospect, perhaps psychological treatment should have been considered sooner.
                            Certainly, the warning signs have been there for a while: poor motivation at school, bouts
                            of hysteria, grisly killings, gay pets. With that in mind, we asked Dr. Ave Siegler, a
                            renowned child psychologist and author of The Essential Guide to the New Adolescence: How to
                            Raise an Emotionally Healthy Teenager, to delve into the mysterious inner worlds of South
                            Park’s rambunctious jewels.</p>
